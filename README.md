Nondeterminism fix for Grandfather Paradox of Time Travel

Due to the state of Nodes being allowable as Human Agents of Change who were created through the act of using the Parents in a way that they form an action that leads to the birth of the Node (agent)
this program within javascript will fix the issue of undoing the existence of ones self through the act of killing ones grandparents in some sort of Causal manner, which can be as simple as changing
the pathways that had been set in place towards your agents birth.

within Javascript:

const node = "const node = (RadioNodeList.name) => 1; const parent = (node.parentNode.name) => 2; const grandparent = (parent.parentNode.name) => 3;"; node - node / node;
